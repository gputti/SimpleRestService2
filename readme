Lot of examples available on internet explaining how to create a simpleREST services using 
embedded jetty server. 

But NOT a single example I found with following combination: 
- run a jetty server in embedded mode +  
- using POST (ton of examples with GET ) +
- using a HTML form  + 
- use Jersey (jax-rs implementation) 

For fun, I added bootstrap forms. So 

So, if you looking for such an example, look no further. Here it is:

How to run:
import this project into your eclipse. 
If you do NOT have eclipse then do a git clone OR 
somehow download the whole project & unzip then from terminal:

cd Rest
IF you have maven skip below command:
java -cp ./target/dependency/*:./target/Rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  com.yaams.Rest.Main
mvn clean compile package dependency:copy-dependencies
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.yaams.Rest.Main"
http://localhost:8080/web/home.html
- add an email and submit 
http://localhost:8080/rest/contacts/list

http://localhost:8080/rest/contacts/test

Note: Main2.java - this type of examples you find all over net. 
I intend to expand this to add a nice UI (mostly using twitter bootstrap framework)  



modus operandi:
1) run Main.java is main program. 
2) go to http://localhost:8080/web/home.html
3) go to http://localhost:8080/rest/contacts/list 
 
To test persistence alone:
run com.yaams.persistence.PersistenceService 

next steps (5/14) 
try running  com.yaams.persistence.PersistenceService with stand alone derby and see 
if data getting inserted. 

then extend UI to take all fields required for contact. 
then do same for User.
